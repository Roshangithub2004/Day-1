#   Day 1 of DSA Practice problem  
    Here i sonved three questions. 

1. Maximun and Minimum Elements in Array
   In this problem, I used brute force method to find Minimun number and Maximum number in a give Array, it gives O(n) time complexity.

2. Reverse Array
   In this problem, I usrd Two Pointers approach to solve the problem and the time complexity is O(n).

3. Maximum Sub-Array Sum 
   In this problem In used Kadanse Algorithm to solve the problem and this problem gives O(n) time complexity.
